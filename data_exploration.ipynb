He is THE GENTLEMAN, a slender dandy in pearl grey gloves and matching waistcoat. A cold and superior aristocrat. The camera slowly revolves -- the Gentleman becoming right side up as--\",\n 'Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd. His skin was pale and his eye was odd.

We see the obscure shape of rigging and sails behind him. The cries of sailors echo. Behind him stand the GENTLEMAN and the BANKER. They are looking past Anthony, looking at something. They move away as Anthony peers through the fog, straining to see... London. Gradually, as the ship approaches, the towering spires and mountainous rooftops of the city begin to stand out in relief, to emerge through the fog like a tiger creeping toward its prey. Music continues as Anthony takes in the dreadful and magnificent spectacle of the 19th Century metropolis. The gnarl of rooftops. The labyrinth of streets and alleys. The black trails of smoke reaching up like skeletal fingers from a thousand chimneys. London. Sulfurous London. Anthony is awestruck.',\n \"I have sailed the world, beheld its wonders From the Dardanelles To the mountains of Peru, But there's no place like London--! Then--\",\n \"Sweeney Todd steps to Anthony's side, grimly interrupting--\",\n \"No, there's no place like London.\",\n 'Mr. Todd...?',\n \"You are young. Life has been kind to you. You will learn. Todd's glares forward, his haunted gaze never leaving the approaching city.\",\n 'Music continues as Todd stands very still and takes in the shadowy figures on the docks. Anthony seems almost lost at his side, overwhelmed by the scale and aura of the city.',\n \"Lord ... takes your breath away, doesn't it? Todd shudders violently, almost snarling.\",\n \"There's a hole in the world Like a great black pit And the vermin of the world Inhabit it And its morals aren't worth What a pig could spit And it goes by the name Of London. At the top of the hole Sit the privileged few Making mock of the vermin In the lower zoo, Turning beauty into filth and greed. I too Have sailed the world, and seen its wonders For the cruelty of men Is as wondrous as Peru, But there's no place like London! Anthony looks at his friend, mystified by his grim reaction to the city.\",\n 'I beg your indulgence, Anthony ... My mind is far from easy. In these once familiar streets I feel shadows everywhere...',\n 'Shadows...?',\n 'Ghosts. Anthony looking at him, questioning. Todd continues quietly:',\n 'There was a barber and his wife, And she was beautiful, A foolish barber and his wife, She was his reason and his life, And she was beautiful, And she was virtuous. And he was... (a breath) Naive. Anthony watches, rapt, as Todd remembers...',\n '...Fifteen years before. Todd walks with his beautiful wife LUCY through a crowded flower market, a colorful explosion of blossoms. Lucy carries their one-year-old baby, JOHANNA. Todd is almost unrecognizable to us, content and smiling. Chatting with his wife. Happy.',\n 'There was another man who saw That she was beautiful, A pious vulture of the law, Who with a gesture of his claw Removed the barber from his plate. Then there was nothing but to wait And she would fall, So soft, So young, So lost, And oh, so beautiful!',\n 'During the above, JUDGE TURPIN, an elderly man with a saturnine demeanor, eyes Lucy through the luxurious bunches of flowers. He stalks her, desiring her. With the Judge is his nefarious creature, BEADLE BAMFORD. The Beadle is a large man, his florid nature and pink, powdered face never quite disguising his lethality. The Judge whispers to the Beadle, indicating Todd. Then the Beadle and several policemen sweep in and drag Todd off. The Judge moves in on Lucy like a predator.

Todd picks up his duffel bag, preparing to go.\",\n 'Will I see you again?',\n 'You might find me, if you like, around Fleet Street.',\n 'Until then, my friend. He offers his hand. Todd takes it and shakes. Then Todd quickly turns and goes. Anthony stands for a moment, saddened by the mysterious pall that hangs over his friend.',\n 'Todd strides along, deep in thought. The emotions roiling within him finally seethe out in a dark mutter:',\n \"There's a hole in the world Like a great black pit And it's filled with people Who are filled with shit And the vermin of the world Inhabit it... He disappears down the street as the music THUNDERS--\",\n '--We ZOOM ahead of Todd -- cutting through the city at lightning pace down twisting alleys and up crowded boulevards -- into tunnels and over bridges -- slashing through London at breakneck speed -- the insane explosion of music sending us hurtling to--',\n \"Fleet Street. We see the exterior of Mrs. Lovett's pie shop. It is tatty and unloved by all. Yet it has a strange, ghostly presence to it. Imposing and dead at the same time. There is an exterior staircase leading up to a darkened second floor room with a window overlooking the street. The music slows and continues as we see Todd, standing in front of the shop, considering it deeply. The GENERAL we saw before passes, glancing at Todd. Here and then gone. Todd finally strides to the shop and enters...\",\n \"Behind the dusty counter is... MRS. LOVETT, a venal, vigorous and slatternly woman in her 40's. She is currently busy chopping a loathsome mess of suet with a wicked looking knife, her greasy hair hanging down over her face.\",\n 'The moment Todd enters -- and the bell at the door sounds -- her head snaps up and her eyes are on him like a bird of prey:',\n 'A customer! Todd is startled, starts to go--',\n \"Wait! What's yer rush? What's yer hurry? (She sticks the knife into the counter) You gave me such a-- (Wipes her hands on her apron) ) Fright. I thought you was a ghost. Half a minute, can'tcher? Sit! Sit ye down! (An order) Sit! (He obeys) All I meant is that I Haven't seen a customer for weeks. Did you come here for a pie, sir? (Todd nods. She flicks a bit of dust off a pie with a rag) Do forgive me if me head's a little vague-- Ugh! (She plucks something off the pie, examines it) What is that? But you'd think we had the plague-- (She drops it on the floor and stamps on it) From the way that people-- (She flicks something off the pie with her finger) Keep avoiding-- (Spotting it moving) No, you don't! (She smacks it with her hand) Heaven knows I try, sir! (Lifts her hand, looks at it) Tsk! (She wipes it on the edge of the counter) But there's no one comes in even to inhale--\",\n \"Tsk! (She blows the last dust off the pie as she brings it to him) Right you are, sir. Would you like a drop of ale? (Todd nods) Mind you, I can't hardly blame them-- (Pouring a tankard of ale) These are probably the worst pies in London. I know why nobody cares to take them-- I should know, I make them. But good? No, The worst pies in London-- Even that's polite. The worst pies in London-- If you doubt it, take a bite. (He does. It's horrible) Is that just disgusting? You have to concede it. It's nothing but crusting-- Here, drink this, you'll need it-- (She gives him the ale) The worst pies in London. During the following, she slams lumps of dough on the counter and rolls them out, grunting frequently as she goes:\",\n \"And no wonder with the price of meat What it is-- (Grunt) When you get it. (Grunt) Never (Grunt) Thought I'd live to see the day Men'd think it was a treat Finding poor (Grunt) Animals (Grunt) Wot are dying in the street. Mrs. Mooney has a pie shop, Does a business, but I noticed something weird-- Lately all her neighbors' cats have disappeared. (Shrugs) Have to hand it to her-- Wot I calls Enterprise, Popping pussies into pies. Wouldn't do in my shop-- Just the thought of it's enough to make you sick.\",\n \"And I'm telling you them pussy cats is quick. (Leans on counter, exhausted) No denying times is hard, sir -- Even harder than The worst pies in London. Only lard and nothing more-- (As Todd gamely tries another mouthful) Is that just revolting? All greasy and gritty, It looks like it's molting, And tastes like-- Well, pity A woman alone With limited wind And the worst pies in London! (Sighs heavily) Ah sir, Times is hard. Times is hard. She finishes one of the crusts with a flourish as the music ends. Todd, meanwhile, is gulping at his ale, trying to wash down Mrs. Lovett's hideous creation.\",\n \"Trust me, dearie, it's going to take more than ale to wash that taste out. Come with me and we'll get you a nice tumbler of gin. She leads him through the curtains at the back of the pie shop and into...\",\n '... Her parlor is a wonder of seedy faux-middle class Victoriana. Little knickknacks, dusty plants and dingy doilies. There is a threadbare mauve sofa in front of a comfortable fire. A faded picture postcard of the seaside hangs on a wall. She goes to a sideboard and pours him a huge glass of gin as:',\n \"Isn't this homey now? Me cheery wallpaper was a real bargain too, it being only partly singed when the chapel burnt down ....\",\n 'She hands him the gin. He gulps it down, washing the taste of her pie out of his mouth.',\n \"There's a good boy, now you sit down and warm your bones, you look chilled through. He sits before the fire:\",\n \"Isn't that a room over the shop? If times are so hard, why don't you rent it out? She glances up at the roof, considering the room over them.\",\n 'Up there? Oh, no one will go near it... She turns to him, something a little intense and probing about her gaze.',\n \"People think it's haunted.\",\n 'Haunted? She holds his gaze.',\n \"And who's to say they're wrong? ... You see, years ago, something happened up there. Something not very nice... The flickering flame from the fire begins to cast a more intense red glow on her face...\",\n 'There was a barber and his wife, And he was beautiful, A proper artist with a knife, But they transported him for life. (Sighs) And he was beautiful... The music continues as she looks at him, again with that rather intense gaze:',\n 'Barker, his name was -- Benjamin Barker.',\n 'Transported? What was his crime?',\n '(with an edge) Foolishness. She turns again to the fire, the red glow bathing her face as she remembers...',\n 'Lucy is pacing, holding Baby Johanna to her closely. Lucy is distraught, strained, tears in her eyes. As Lucy paces we notice the room is full of dead and dying flowers: dozens of dried bouquets tossed aside and ignored.',\n 'He had this wife, you see, Pretty little thing, Silly little nit Had her chance for the moon on a string-- Poor thing. Poor thing. Lucy moves to the window, looks out. She sees Judge Turpin and the Beadle waiting below. The Judge holds yet another bouquet.',\n \"There was this Judge, you see, Wanted her like mad, Every day he'd send her a flower, But did she come down from her tower? Sat up there and sobbed by the hour, Poor fool. Lucy moves away from the window, sobbing.\",\n 'Ah, but there was worse yet to come, Poor thing.',\n 'The Beadle is leading a nervous Lucy along an exclusive street of dark stone mansions, grand but somehow menacing. Lucy is wearing her best dress.',\n 'The Beadle calls on her, all polite, Poor thing, poor thing. The Judge, he tells her, is all contrite, He blames himself for her dreadful plight She must come straight to his house tonight! Poor thing, poor thing.',\n 'The Beadle ushers Lucy into a ballroom. She is shocked to see a fancy-dress ball in progress. Masked couples swirl around the ballroom, their number sinisterly multiplied by the distorting mirrors that frame the room. The hanging chandeliers, draped in red cloth, cast a disquieting incarnadine glow on the proceedings...',\n \"Of course, when she goes there, Poor thing, poor thing, They're having this ball all in masks. Lucy wanders lost through the swirling dancers, they buffet her, confusing her...\",\n 'There\\'s no one she knows there, Poor dear, poor thing, She wanders tormented, and drinks, Poor thing. The Judge has repented, she thinks, Poor thing. \"Oh, where is Judge Turpin?\" she asks. The Beadle finds Lucy again and graciously gives her his arm, leading her through the party. She is thankful for the salvation he provides. He brings her to Judge Turpin. The Judge descends on Lucy, raping her. The other guests crowd around ravenously, enjoying the spectacle. A feverish nightmare.',\n \"He was there, all right-- Only not so contrite! She wasn't no match for such craft, you see,\",\n 'And everyone thought it so droll. They figured she had to be daft, you see, So all of `em stood there and laughed, you see, Poor soul! Poor thing!',\n \"Todd's wild howl shatters the memory and tears us back to--\",\n '--Todd is bolting up from the sofa, tormented--',\n 'He stands for a terrible beat.',\n 'Would no one have mercy on her?',\n 'So it is you -- Benjamin Barker.',\n \"Where's Lucy?! Where's my wife?!\",\n \"She poisoned herself. Arsenic from the apothecary on the corner. I tried to stop her but she wouldn't listen to me. And he's got your daughter.\",\n 'He? Judge Turpin?',\n 'Adopted her like his own. Todd absorbs this sickening news.',\n 'Fifteen years of sweating in a living hell on a false charge. Fifteen years dreaming that I might come home to find a loving wife and child... A beat as he stares into the fire, madness and purpose creeping in.',\n \"Well, I can't say the years have been particularly kind to you, Mr. Barker, but you still--\",\n \"No, not Barker. That man is dead. It's Todd now. Sweeney Todd ... And he will have his revenge. He continues with a chilling and quiet resolve as he stares with unblinking eyes into the fire:\",\n 'Judge Turpin and the Beadle will pay for what they did. A beat. He finally turns to her.',\n 'First I must have my shop back.',\n 'They emerge from the pie shop. She begins to scale the exterior staircase to the darkened second floor room. He hesitates.',\n 'Come along... She continues up, he slowly follows.',\n \"A macabre shroud of dust and spider's webs. Furniture covered in sheets. A broken mirror on one wall. We hear footsteps approaching and then Mrs. Lovett enters. The door creaks like a living thing.\",\n 'Not to worry, a touch of oil will put that right. (she turns back to Todd) ... Nothing to be afraid of, love, come in. She moves into the room. But Todd hesitates at the door, looking into the room. For him this is a truly haunted place.',\n 'Meanwhile, she kneels and pries loose a floorboard. Underneath there is a hidden area. Within that, something covered with a velvet cloth. She removes it and carefully unwraps it. Her touch is particularly gentle and respectful. We discover it is a fine leather case. She looks at it for a beat. Then turns to him, dusting it off.',\n \"I don't believe it... He finally steps into the room, drawn toward the case.\",\n \"When they came for the girl, I hid 'em. I thought, who knows? Maybe the silly blighter'll be back again. Cracked in the head, wasn't I? Haunting music begins as she opens the case... And we see it contains a beautiful set of razors. He stands for a long moment, gazing down at his beloved razors.\",\n \"Those handles is chased silver, ain't they?\",\n \"Silver, yes... These are my friends, See how they glisten. (He picks up a small razor) See this one shine, How he smiles in the light. My friend, my faithful friend. (Holding it to his ear, feeling the edge with his thumb) ) Speak to me friend, Whisper, I'll listen. (Listening) I know, I know-- You've been locked out of sight All these years-- Like me, my friend. Well, I've come home To find you waiting.\",\n \"Home, And we're together, And we'll do wonders, Won't we? Mrs. Lovett leans over him, in her own kind of trance as well. They now sing simultaneously:\",\n \"(Picking out a larger razor) You there, my friend, Come, let me hold you. Now, with a sigh You grow warm In my hand, My friend, My clever friend. (Putting it back) Rest now, my friends. Soon I'll unfold you. Soon you'll know splendors You never have dreamed All your days--\",\n \"I'm your friend too, Mr. Todd.

I'm your friend.\",\n \"And you're mine. Don't they shine beautiful? Silver's good enough for me, Mr. T... The music continues quietly as Todd stares at one of his razors.\",\n 'Leave me now... She goes. Todd finally picks up his biggest razor and slowly opens it, looks at it.',\n 'At last my arm is complete again. And he remains standing. Exalted. Then-- In the shattered mirror on the wall he suddenly sees-- The distorted reflections of the Gentleman, the Banker, and the General, looking at him--',\n 'Lift your razor high, Sweeney! Hear it singing, \"Yes!\" Sink it in the rosy skin Of righteousness! Todd turns to them...',\n \"(variously) His voice was soft, his manner mild. He seldom laughed but he often smiled, He'd seen how civilized men behave. He never forgot and he never forgave, Not Sweeney, Not Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. Todd pulls a sheet off Baby Johanna's cradle. A cloud of dust rises. The ghosts disappear in the cloud of dust and Todd stands alone, staring at the cradle, holding his razor.\",\n \"Anthony, now out of his sailor's uniform, is walking along the sidewalk near the Judge's mansion, absorbed in a copy of Baedeker's London. He stops, lost, trying to get his bearings, studying his map. Then an unusual sound emerges through the normal cosmopolitan bustle. It is the sound of a woman humming. He looks up to see... JOHANNA, a 16-year-old girl with golden hair, beautiful and hauntingly sad. She sits at her window above, behind bars, humming to herself as she does needlepoint. Anthony watches her, absolutely mesmerized. Johanna notices a Bird Seller passing. He carries a long, wooden pole with little bird cages attached.\",\n 'Green finch and linnet bird, Nightingale, blackbird, How is it you sing? How can you jubilate, Sitting in cages, Never taking wing? Outside the sky waits, Beckoning, beckoning, Just beyond the bars. How can you remain, Staring at the rain, Maddened by the stars? How is it you sing Anything? How is it you sing? Then ... she sees Anthony on the sidewalk below. Music continues. There is a long look between them. Her intense, melancholy expression moves him. She continues singing, the strange anguish and yearning of her words seem intended only for him...',\n \"My cage has many rooms, Damask and dark. Nothing there sings, Not even my lark. Larks never will, you know, When they're captive.\",\n 'Teach me to be more adaptive. Green finch and linnet bird, Nightingale, blackbird, Teach me how to sing. If I cannot fly, Let me sing. Then she turns away quickly, alarmed, when someone enters her room. She looks terrified. Below, Anthony is concerned for her. He sees her move from the window. He is craning to see better when a BEGGAR WOMAN -- a filthy tendril of a woman, her foul clothes of rags like a second skin -- suddenly thrusts her arm up from the curb, imploring:',\n 'Alms! ... Alms! ... For a miserable woman On a miserable chilly morning... (Anthony drops a coin into her hand) Thank yer, sir, thank yer.',\n \"Ma'am, could tell me whose house this is?\",\n \"That's the great Judge Turpin's house that is.\",\n 'And the young lady who resides there?',\n \"That's Johanna, his pretty little ward. Keeps her snug, he does, all locked up ... So don't you go trespassing there or it's a good whipping for you -- or any other young man with mischief on his mind... She suddenly leers into a lewd and demented assault:\",\n \"'Ow would you like a little muff, dear, A little jig jig A little bounce around the bush? Wouldn't you like to push me parsley?\",\n \"It looks to me, dear, Like you got plenty there to push. She grabs at Anthony's crotch -- Anthony starts back -- she turns away, instantly plaintive again, and appeals to other pedestrians as she goes:\",\n 'Alms! ... Alms!... For a desperate woman... Anthony considers the mansion. He sees a figure standing at a window, unclear behind the shutters, watching him. He sits on a bench outside the mansion and sings quietly:',\n \"I feel you, Johanna, I feel you. I was half convinced I'd waken, Satisfied enough to dream you. Happily I was mistaken, Johanna! I'll steal you, Johanna, I'll steal you... Then the figure disappears from the window above. Anthony stands, waits. Then the doors to the mansion swing open... Anthony is expecting Johanna... But it is Judge Turpin, the predator we met in Todd's flashback, who steps into the doorway. He seems a different man now. Paternal and warm, he smiles and beckons to Anthony. Anthony hesitates, unsure. The Judge beckons again. Again the warm smile.\",\n 'Come in, lad. Come in... Anthony goes into the mansion.',\n 'Judge Turpin leads Anthony into the dark library, filled with books. Anthony is looking around for Johanna. He is wary, this is all very strange.',\n '... you were looking for Hyde Park, you say?',\n \"Yes, it's terribly large on the map but I keep getting lost...\",\n 'Sit down, lad, sit down. Anthony sits, uncomfortable, as the Judge pours two snifters of brandy.',\n \"It's embarrassing for a sailor to lose his bearings, but, well, there you are. Then... The large form of the Beadle appears from the shadows. No introduction is made. Anthony glances to him, uneasy.\",\n 'A sailor, eh?',\n 'Yes, sir. The \"Bountiful\" out of Plymouth.',\n '(handing him a snifter of brandy) A sailor must know the ways of the world, yes? ... Must be practiced in the ways of the world ... Would you say you are practiced, boy?',\n 'Sir? The Judge moves to consider some beautiful volumes, bound in the richest leather. He runs a finger along the spines of the books; his large library of pornography.',\n 'Oh, yes ... such practices ... the geishas of Japan ... the concubines of Siam .. the catamites of Greece ... the harlots of India ... I have them all here ... Drawings of them ....',\n \"JUDGE (he turns again to Anthony) ... All the vile things you've done with your whores. Anthony is speechless. The Judge just smiles at him amiably.\",\n 'Would you like to see?',\n \"(standing) I think there's been some mistake--\",\n 'Oh, I think not. You gandered at my ward, Johanna ... You gandered at her ... Yes, sir, you gandered. The Beadle moves behind Anthony.',\n '(glancing nervously back at the Beadle) I meant no harm--',\n \"Your meaning is immaterial. Mark me: if I see your face again on this street, you'll rue the day your bitch of a mother gave you birth. Anthony is stunned. The Judge proceeds with shocking venom:\",\n \"My Johanna isn't one of your bloody cock-chafers! My Johanna is not to be gandered at! He nods to the Beadle -- the Beadle instantly grabs Anthony and brutally hauls him out.\",\n 'The Beadle drags Anthony through a rear door of the mansion and flings him into a filthy alley. Anthony pulls himself up. Stunned.',\n 'Hyde Park is that way, young sir ... A right and then a left, then straight on, you see? ...',\n \"BEADLE (points) ... Over there. Flustered, Anthony turns to look-- The instant Anthony's back is turned, the Beadle swings his lethal billyclub and SLAMS him from behind brutally, in the kidneys -- Anthony's knees buckle-- The Beadle then SLAMS Anthony across the back of the neck -- Anthony falls hard-- The Beadle then uses one dainty foot to roll Anthony over-- Anthony gazes up at him, panting for breath, in agony--\",\n \"You heard Judge Turpin, little man. He presses the end of his billyclub into Anthony's forehead, grinding it hard--\",\n \"Next time it'll be your pretty brains all over the pavement. With that, the Beadle returns to the mansion and slams the door. Anthony slowly pulls himself to his knees, doubled over, coughing up blood. A long beat as Anthony gets his breath, wiping blood from his face. Still doubled over, he sings with burning intensity:\",\n \"I'll steal you, Johanna, I'll steal you! Do they think that walls can hide you? Even now I'm at your window. I am in the dark beside you, Buried sweetly in your yellow hair. He pulls himself up, every movement is agony. He makes his way down the alley, leaning on the wall for support.\",\n 'The music swells as Anthony emerges from the dark alley into the bright sunlight. He makes his way along the sidewalk:',\n \"I feel you, Johanna, And one day I'll steal you. Till I'm with you then, I'm with you there, Sweetly buried in your yellow hair... The soaring music continues as Anthony stops at a park across the street from Turpin's mansion, bravely gazing up at Johanna's window.\",\n 'Sweeney Todd and Mrs. Lovett are moving quickly, she struggles to keep up with his long, loping stride. He carries his razor case, she carries a shopping basket.',\n \"He's here every Thursday?\",\n 'Like clockwork. Eyetalian. All the rage he is.',\n 'Not for long.',\n 'They round a corner and move into the bustling marketplace. A steady mercantile hum as the cries of merchants and wandering coster-mongers fill the air. Todd and Mrs. Lovett move toward a hand-drawn caravan dominating one corner of the marketplace. It is painted like a Sicilian donkey cart and on its side a sign declaims: \"Signor Adolfo Pirelli -- Haircutter to His Royal Majesty the King of Naples.\"',\n 'Oh Mr. T., do you really think you can do it?',\n \"By tomorrow they'll all be flocking to me like sheep to be shorn-- He stops abruptly when he sees-- The Beadle casually strolling through the crowd. Todd is transfixed, his ancient enemy so close.\",\n '(seeing the Beadle, pulling his arm) Come along now, dear, he might recognize you--',\n \"I will do what I have vowed to do ... (he continues to glare at the Beadle, his voice low) ... Come closer, my friend, closer... Then, TOBY -- a 13-year-old boy, a bit small for his age, malnourished and consumptively pale -- emerges from Pirelli's caravan. He bangs on a tin drum, drawing customers. A crowd begins to gather at the caravan as:\",\n 'Ladies and gentlemen! May I have your attention, perlease? Do you wake every morning in shame and despair To discover your pillow is covered with hair Wot ought not to be there? Well, ladies and gentlemen, From now on you can waken at ease. You need never again have a worry or care, I will show you a miracle marvelous rare, Gentlemen, you are about to see something wot rose from the dead! (A woman gasps, he smiles and wiggles a finger no) On the top of my head. He dramatically doffs his cap, revealing mountains of hair which cascade to his shoulder.',\n \"'Twas Pirelli's Miracle Elixir, That's wot did the trick, sir, True, sir, true. Was it quick, sir? Did it in a tick, sir? Just like an elixir Ought to do! (To a Bald Man) How about a bottle, mister? Only costs a penny, guaranteed. (Pours a drop on the bald man's head) Does Pirelli's\",\n \"Stimulate the growth, sir? You can have my oath, sir, 'Tis unique. (Applies the bald man's hand to the wet spot) Rub a minute, Stimulatin', i'n it? Soon you'll have to thin it Once a week! More customers are stepping up and buying bottles. Todd opens a bottle of the Elixir, takes a whiff. Disgusting. He smiles to Mrs. Lovett, his plan falling into place.\",\n \"(loudly, to Mrs. Lovett) Pardon me, ma'am, what's that awful stench?\",\n 'Are we standing near an open trench?',\n '(to a woman in the crowd) Must be standing near an open trench! The crowd responds to Todd and Mrs. Lovett, looking askance and sniffing at the bottles. Toby nervously tries to distract them:',\n \"Buy Pirelli's Miracle Elixir: Anything wot's slick, sir, Soon sprouts curls. Try Pirelli's! When they see how thick, sir, You can have your pick, sir, Of the girls! Want to buy a bottle, missus?\",\n '(sniffing bottle of Elixir) What is this?',\n \"(sniffing another customer's bottle) What is this?\",\n 'Smells like piss.',\n 'Smells like -- phew!',\n 'This is piss. Piss with ink. The music speeds up -- Toby is getting desperate:',\n \"Let Pirelli's Activate your roots, sir--\",\n 'Keep it off your boots, sir-- Eats right through.',\n \"Yes, get Pirelli's! Use a bottle of it! Ladies seem to love it--\",\n 'Flies do too! Suddenly, the curtains on the caravan are dramatically flung wide to reveal-- PIRELLI, a flamboyant Italian with a velvet suit, thick wavy hair and a dazzling smile. Pirelli poses splendidly for a moment. Then:',\n 'I am Adolfo Pirelli, Da king of da barbers, da barber of kings, E buon giorno, good day, I blow you a kiss!

I am Mr. Sweeney Todd of Fleet Street. I have opened a bottle of Pirelli's elixir, and I say to you that it is nothing but an arrant fraud, concocted from piss and ink.\",\n 'The crowd gasps. Pirelli is about to respond, outraged, but Todd continues--',\n 'And furthermore -- \"signor\" -- I have serviced no kings, yet I wager I can shave a cheek with ten times more dexterity that any street mountebank. He snaps open his razor case and holds it up for the crowd to see, turning to display the wondrous razors:',\n 'You see these razors?',\n '(to the crowd) The finest in England.',\n '(glaring at Pirelli) I lay them against five pounds you are no match for me. You hear me, sir? Either accept my challenge or reveal yourself as a sham.',\n 'Bravo, bravo. The crowd is enjoying this now, whispering eagerly about the bold challenge. In the crowd, we see a quick flash of the meek TOURIST we saw earlier. Pirelli studies the razors for a moment and then turns to the crowd with a confident smile:',\n 'You hear zis foolish man? Watch and see how he will regret his folly! Music begins as Todd moves into action, preparing the challenge:',\n \"Friends, who's for a free shave? Two men step forward. A plain wooden chair is brought for Todd as he moves into the boldest part of this plan... He carefully turns to ... The Beadle.\",\n 'Will Beadle Bamford be the judge?',\n \"Mrs. Lovett's eyes shoot to Todd, alarmed-- The Beadle moves toward Todd .... Todd smiles amiably, but quivers internally at being so dreadfully close to his prey... Mrs. Lovett watches, concerned. Will the Beadle recognize the features of Benjamin Barker...? Apparently not. The Beadle stops right before Todd and smiles.\",\n \"Glad, as always, to oblige my friends and neighbors (to the crowd) ... Let the challenge commence! One man sits in Todd's plain chair as the other moves to an elaborate chair on Pirelli's caravan. Pirelli shakes out a fancy bib with a flourish and covers his man. Toby prepares Pirelli's ornate shaving supplies as Todd takes a plain towel and tucks it around his man's neck.\",\n 'Ready?',\n 'Ready!',\n 'Ready.',\n \"The fastest, smoothest shave is the winner. He blows his shrill whistle. Agitated music begins. Pirelli strops his razor quickly, Todd in a leisurely manner. Pirelli keeps glancing at Todd in various paranoid ways throughout, frightened of Todd's progress. He starts whipping up lather rapidly:\",\n '(while mixing furiously) Now, signorini, signori, We mix-a da lather But first-a you gather Around, signorini, signori, You looking a man',\n \"Who have had-a da glory To shave-a da Pope. Mr. Sweeney-so-smart-- (Splatters the customer with shaving cream) Oh, I beg-a you pardon -- 'll Call me a lie, was-a only a cardinal-- Nope! It was-a da Pope! Unexpectedly, Todd still shows no signs of starting to shave his man. He merely watches Pirelli's performance. Mrs. Lovett looks at him nervously, wishing he would get on with it. Pirelli, now feeling he can take his time, sings lyrically as he lathers and shaves with rhythmic scrapes and elaborate gestures of wiping the razor.\",\n \"To shave-a da face, To cut-a da hair, Require da grace Require da flair, For if-a you slip, You nick da skin, You clip-a da chin, You rip-a da lip a bit Beyond-a repair! Todd strops his razor slowly and deliberately -- shoop, shoop, shoop -- disconcerting Pirelli and drawing the crowd's attention.\",\n 'To shave-a da face Or even a part Widout it-a smart Require da heart. Not just-a da flash, It take-a panache, It take-a da passion For da art. Todd is unconcerned. He just continues to slowly strop his razor -- shoop, shoop, shoop -- which flusters Pirelli.',\n 'To shave-a da face, To trim-a da beard, To make-a da bristle Clean like a whistle, Dis is from early infancy Da talent give to me',\n \"By God! (Crosses himself with his razor) It take-a da skill, It take-a da brains, It take-a da will To take-a da pains, It take-a da pace, It take-a da graaaaaace... While Pirelli holds this note elaborately, Todd, with a few deft strokes, quickly lathers his man's face, shaves him and signals the Beadle to examine him.\",\n '(blowing whistle) The winner is Todd. Pirelli deflates.',\n \"(feeling the customer's cheek) Smooth as a baby's arse! -- (to Todd) - - Well done, dear! The crowd laughs and applauds Todd as Pirelli goes to him:\",\n '(a profound bow) Sir, I bow to a skill far defter than my own.',\n 'The five pounds. Pirelli produces a distinctive chatelaine purse and removes a five pound note, gives it to Todd:',\n 'Here, sir. And may the good Lord smile on you -- (a quick stab of a smile) -- Until we meet again. He bows his head quickly and then moves away, beckoning to Toby:',\n 'Come, boy.',\n \"We're pulling out, sir?\",\n 'Without warning, Pirelli SLAPS Toby viciously across the face --Toby almost falls--',\n \"(snarling) We're pulling out, yes. Quickly. Mrs. Lovett has observed all of this as she moves away with Todd, who is making his way inexorably toward the Beadle. Some eager customers surround Todd, among them is the\",\n 'Mr. Todd, sir, do you have an establishment of your own? Mrs. Lovett is on him like a hawk:',\n \"He certainly does.

You are a paragon of integrity.',\n 'Well, I try to do my best for my friends and neighbors ...

She chatters happily:',\n \"... Like to give me a coronary right there! What if he had recognized you! Lord, my heart was beating a mile a minute, just like a little finch it was. Aren't those lovely birds now? Always so twittery and happy... She continues chattering... But Todd is not listening. His eyes dart to the side to see-- The Gentleman is walking next to him, whispering, subtle, insinuating...\",\n \"Sweeney pondered and Sweeney planned. Like a perfect machine 'e planned... The Banker moves in next to the Gentleman...\",\n 'Barbing the hook, baiting the trap, Setting it out for the Beadle to snap...

Suppose it's just me gentle heart, but I do hate to see a boy treated like that, no better than your Aunt Doreen's dog -- Mr. Todd, are you listening to me?\",\n 'Of course. But then his eyes dart again -- looking for the specters. He only sees strangers.',\n 'Johanna sits, framed by the window, quietly cutting out silhouettes. Aimless Victorian handicrafts. But we see there are tears in her eyes. She steals a glance across the room. We see a small hole in the wallpaper. Through this hole, the Judge is watching her from another chamber. Lascivious. Perverse. Johanna finally stands and casually glances out from between the shutters at her window. She sees... Anthony, standing at the park across the street, keeping up his lonely vigil, gazing up at the mansion. She watches him for a moment and then makes her decision. She moves to a table and opens a drawer. Reaches in and removes something...',\n 'Anthony sees a figure at the shutters -- then hears a clinking sound. Metal on pavement. He quickly moves across the street and looks... A key, dropped from above. He looks up to the shutters and smiles, then snatches up the key and hurries off.',\n 'Peering through the shutters, Johanna watches him go. We linger on her face and then dissolve to another face, also watching...',\n \"... Her father. Todd's face, staring out the window, intense and brooding. Seething with discontent. Mrs. Lovett chatters as she moves around behind him:\",\n \"... It's not much of a chair, I'll grant, but it'll serve. Was me poor Albert's chair. Sat in it all day long he did, after his leg give out from the gout, poor dear. He moves from the window and paces like a caged tiger in the small barber shop. Though it has been cleaned, it is still a spartan room. A tatty parlor chair. A large chest. A few counters with meager bottles of tonsorial supplies. And his gleaming razors, always waiting.\",\n 'Why doesn\\'t the Beadle come? \"Before the week is out,\" that\\'s what he said.',\n \"And who says the week's out? It's only Tuesday.

She dares to move closer...\",\n \"I've been thinking, flowers-- Maybe daisies-- To brighten up the room. Don't you think some flowers, Pretty daisies, Might relieve the gloom? Ah, wait, love, wait.

Always broodin' away on yer wrongs what happened heaven knows how many years ago... Don't you know, Silly man, Half the fun is to Plan the plan? All good things come to Those who can Wait.

Well, we'll soon see to that...\",\n \"(alert, sees something) What's this? Mrs. Lovett joins him at the window.

He didn't have your nice full head though--\",\n 'To tell the truth -- (he pulls off the wig which covers his own short-cropped hair) -- it gets awful hot.',\n 'Pirelli is expansively strolling around the shop, taking it all in, savoring every second:',\n \"... yes, this will do very nicely ...

Without a word of warning-- Like a thunderbolt-- Todd is on him.

Todd at this moment, however, does. He smiles nervously.\",\n 'So, hmmm, Mrs. Lovett gave you a pie, did she?',\n \"She's a real lady. Model of all true Christian virtue.

Thanking you kindly, sir! You're a Christian indeed! He races out happily and clatters down the stairs. A beat as Todd gets his breath. Then he goes to the trunk, leans down to open it, the camera follows him down and up again, when he rises-- The GENTLEMAN is standing right behind him! Todd turns. The Gentleman's face is completely impassive. He is not spectral. He does not disappear. He just stands there. Todd looks at him. Then the Gentleman's eyes slowly move to a counter...

The music reaches a thundering crescendo as-- He flings her into the oven and slams the doors-- We hear her screaming. And banging on the oven doors. Todd sinks to his knees and covers his ears desperately as the banging and screaming and music finally fade to silence. Then he slowly drags himself across the floor to the Beggar Woman. He cradles her head in his arms.',\n \"There was a barber and his wife, And she was beautiful. A foolish barber and his wife, She was his reason and his life. And she was beautiful. And she was virtuous. And he was... Todd folds himself over his dead wife. The only sound his deep, anguished sobs. A long beat. Then he becomes aware of something. He looks over to see.... Toby -- staring at him from the open sewer grate. He has seen everything. Todd watches as Toby silently pulls himself up. Todd gently sets Lucy down and then, still kneeling, turns to face Toby. A long beat as they look at each other. Then Toby slowly moves and carefully picks up Todd's razor. Todd looks at him. Then slowly unbuttons his collar and exposes his neck. He bends his head back, offering his naked throat. Toby slowly goes to him and methodically slits his throat. Todd continues to gaze up at Toby as we hear the lonely sound of wind escaping from his severed wind pipe. Then Toby turns and leaves the bakehouse. Todd leans forward, dying. We cut to his point-of-view: The rough brick floor... From the bottom of the frame... A dark pool of blood slowly begins to spread ... moving up the frame ... the fiery glow from the bake oven reflected in the blood...\",\n \"Finally, the pool of blood fills the entire frame. We realize this is the first image we saw in the story. Todd's perspective. Todd's blood. As he dies. As before, the Gentleman's face appears, reflected in the pool of blood...\",\n 'Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd, His skin was pale and his eye was odd. The Banker emerges from the shadows of the bakehouse...',\n 'He shaved the faces of gentlemen Who never thereafter were heard of again. The General emerges ... and the Tourist ... and the Priest ... and the Student...',\n '(variously) He trod a path that few have trod, Did Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. Then a new ghost ... a face we recognize ... the Beggar Woman...',\n 'He kept a shop in London town, Of fancy clients and good renown. She is joined by the Judge...',\n 'And what if none of their souls were saved? They went to their maker impeccably shaved.',\n 'By Sweeney, By Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. The Beadle and Pirelli join the ghosts...',\n 'Swing your razor wide, Sweeney! Hold it to the skies! Freely flows the blood of those Who moralize!',\n 'The ghosts move around the bakehouse, considering the meat grinder and stained cleavers and chopping block...',\n '(variously) His needs are few, his room is bare. He hardly uses his fancy chair. The more he bleeds, the more he lives. He never forgets and he never forgives. Perhaps today you gave a nod To Sweeney Todd. The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. Hunting like predators, we begin to move urgently through the ghosts. Their long shadows tower bizarrely against the walls and ceiling of the bakehouse. The fiery red roar of the bake oven builds in intensity...',\n \"(variously) Sweeney wishes the world away, Sweeney's weeping for yesterday, Hugging the blade, waiting the years, Hearing the music that nobody hears. Sweeney waits in the parlor hall, Sweeney leans on the office wall. No one can help, nothing can hide you-- Isn't that Sweeney there beside you? Sweeney wishes the world away, Sweeney's weeping for yesterday, Is Sweeney! There he is, it's Sweeney! Sweeney! Sweeney! We tear through them with increasing frenzy -- cutting quickly, vertiginous angles -- as the music builds--\",\n '(variously) There! There! There! There! There! There! There! (almost a scream now) There! They move away-- Revealing-- Todd and Mrs. Lovett. Facing each other. We circle them:',\n 'Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd! He served a dark and a hungry god!',\n '(sharply to Mrs. Lovett) To seek revenge may lead to hell.',\n '(coldly to him) But everyone does it, if seldom as well--',\n '--As Sweeney...',\n 'As Sweeney Todd... The Demon Barber of Fleet... The ghosts begin to disappear ... fading into the shadows of the bakehouse ... leaving Todd and Mrs. Lovett alone...',\n \"... Street! The febrile music continues as Todd and Mrs. Lovett stand alone, continuing to glare at each other. Finally she gives him a grim little smile and disappears into the darkness. He stands alone. And we cut to-- A series of images from earlier in our story, cut to the music -- Todd's life flashing before his eyes -- The images building as the music races toward its conclusion-- Todd singing -- slashing -- smiling -- striding-- The final crash of music at the final image: Todd kneeling, hunched over the pool of blood on the bakehouse floor. He falls... Into the blood. Dead.\",\n 'Snap to black. The End']"

    "VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) is a lexical-based model used for text sentiment analysis. It is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. VADER is plug and play: it can be applied directly to unlabeled text data without tokenization. VADER is also sensitive to negation, capitalization and punctuation. Given a sentence, VADER returns a dictionary of scores in each of four categories: negative, neutral, positive and compound (normalized score for the three before). We can use the compound score to map sentiment in a uni-variate time series."

Mankind has waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe -- they decide to land and investigate. Their search takes them to a wrecked alien spacecraft whose doors gape open -- it is dead and abandoned. Inside they find, among other strange things, the skeleton of one of the unearthly space travellers. Certain clues in the wrecked ship lead them across the hostile surface of the planet to a primitive stone pyramid, the only remnant of a vanished civilization. Beneath this pyramid they find an ancient tomb full of fantastic artifacts. Lying dormant in the tomb are centuries- old spores, which are triggered into life by the men's presence. A parasite emerges and fastens itself to one of the men's faces -- and cannot be removed. An examination by the ship's medical computer reveals that the creature has inserted a tube down his throat, which is depositing something inside him. Then it is discovered that the parasite's blood is a horribly corrosive acid which eats through metal -- they dare not kill it on the ship. Ultimately it is dislodged from its victim and ejected from the ship, and they blast off from the Hell-planet. However, before they can seal themselves into suspended animation for the long voyage home, a horrible little monster emerges from the victim's body -- it has been growing in him, deposited there by the parasite... and now it is loose on the ship. A series of ghastly adventures follow. They trap it in an air shaft and a man has to crawl down the shaft with a flamethrower -- it tears a man's head off and runs away with his body -- a man is crushed in the air lock door and the ship loses most of its air in a terrific windstorm -- another man is burned to death and then eaten by the creature -- and another is woven into a cocoon as part of the alien's bizarre life cycle. Finally there is only one man left alive, alone on the ship with the creature, and only six hours till his air runs out; which leads to a climax of horrifying, explosive jeopardy, the outcome of which determines who will reach Earth alive -- man or alien.\",\n 'Captain.................A leader and a politician. Believes that any action is better than no action.',\n 'Executive Officer.......Cautious but intelligent -- a survivor.',\n 'Navigator...............Adventurer; brash glory-hound.',\n 'Communications..........Tech Intellectual; a romantic.',\n 'Mining Engineer.........High-strung; came along to make his fortune.',\n 'Engine Tech.............A worker. Unimaginative. The crew is unisex and all parts are interchangeable for men or women. FADE IN: EXTREME CLOSEUPS OF FLICKERING INSTRUMENT PANELS. Readouts and digital displays pulse eerily with the technology of the distant future. Wherever we are, it seems to be chill, dark, and sterile. Electronic machinery chuckles softly to itself. Abruptly we hear a BEEPING SIGNAL, and the machinery begins to awaken. Circuits close, lights blink on. CAMERA ANGLES GRADUALLY WIDEN, revealing more and more of the machinery, banks of panels, fluttering gauges, until we reveal: INTERIOR - HYPERSLEEP VAULT A stainless steel room with no windows, the walls packed with instrumentation. The lights are dim and the air is frigid. Occupying most of the floor space are rows of horizontal FREEZER COMPARTMENTS, looking for all the world like meat lockers. FOOM! FOOM! FOOM! With explosions of escaping gas, the lids on the freezers pop open. Slowly, groggily, six nude men sit up.',\n 'Oh... God... am I cold...',\n 'Is that you, Roby?',\n 'I feel like shit...',\n \"Yeah, it's you all right. Now they are yawning, stretching, and shivering.\",\n '(groans) Ohh... I must be alive, I feel dead.',\n 'You look dead.',\n 'The vampires rise from their graves.

This draws a LAUGH.',\n \"Okay! Everybody topside! Let's get our pants on and get to our posts! The men begin to swing out of the freezers.\",\n 'Somebody get the cat. Roby picks a limp cat out of a freezer. INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM This is a fantastic circular room, jammed with instrumentation. There are no windows, but above head level the room is ringed by viewscreens, all blank for the moment. There are seats for four men. Each chair faces a console and is surrounded by a dazzling array of technology. STANDARD, ROBY, BROUSSARD, and MELKONIS are entering and finding their seats.',\n \"I'm going to buy a cattle ranch.\",\n '(putting down the cat) Cattle ranch!',\n \"I'm not kidding. You can get one if you have the credit. Look just like real cows, too.\",\n \"All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.\",\n 'Right. Fire up all systems. They begin to throw switches, lighting up their consoles. The control room starts to come to life. All around the room, colored lights flicker and chase each other across glowing screens. The room fills with the hum and chatter of machinery.',\n 'Sandy, you want to give us some vision?',\n 'Feast your eyes. Melkonis reaches to his console and presses a bank of switches. The strip of viewscreens flickers into life. On each screen, we see BLACKNESS SPECKLED WITH STARS.',\n \"(after a pause) Where's Irth?\",\n 'Sandy, scan the whole sky. Melkonis hits buttons. On the screens the images all begin to pan. CAMERA MOVES IN ON ONE OF THE SCREENS, with its moving image of a starfield. EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE CLOSE SHOT OF A PANNING TV CAMERA.

We haven't even reached the outer rim yet.\",\n 'What the hell? Standard picks up a microphone.',\n 'This is Chaz speaking. Sorry, but we are not home. Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.',\n \"Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert. A high priority from the computer...\",\n \"Let's hear it.\",\n '(punches buttons) Computer, you have signalled a priority three message. What is the message?',\n '(a mechanical voice) I have interrupted the course of the voyage.',\n 'What? Why?',\n 'I am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise.',\n 'Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about?',\n 'I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.',\n 'A transmission?',\n 'A voice transmission.',\n 'Out here? The men exchange glances.',\n 'I have recorded the transmission.',\n 'Play it for us, please. Over the speakers, we hear a hum, a crackle, static... THEN A STRANGE, UNEARTHLY VOICE FILLS THE ROOM, SPEAKING AN ALIEN LANGUAGE. The bizarre voice speaks a long sentence, then falls silent. The men all stare at each other in amazement.',\n 'Computer, what language was that?',\n 'Unknown.',\n 'Unknown! What do you mean?',\n 'It is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man. There is a pause, then EVERYBODY STARTS TALKING AT THE SAME TIME.',\n '(silencing them) Just hold it, hold it! (glares around the room) Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?',\n 'Yes. There are two points of salient interest. Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin. Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.',\n 'Oh my God.',\n \"Well, it's finally happened.\",\n 'First contact...',\n 'Sandy, can you home in on that beam?',\n \"What's the frequency?\",\n \"Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?\",\n '65330 dash 99.

It's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.\",\n 'Dell -- show me that on a screen.',\n \"I'll give it to you on number four. Broussard punches buttons. One of the viewscreens flickers, and a small dot of light becomes visible in the corner of the screen.\",\n \"That's it. Let me straighten it out.

Seems to me we came on this trip to make some credit, not to go off on some kind of side trip.\",\n '(excited) Forget the credit; what we have here is a chance to be the first men to contact a nonhuman intelligence.',\n \"If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped.\",\n \"Hell, we're equipped --\",\n \"Hell, no! We don't know what's down there on that piece of rock! It might be dangerous! What we should do is get on the radio to the exploration authorities... and let them deal with it.\",\n \"Except it will take 75 years to get a reply back. Don't forget how far we are from the Colonies, Martin.\",\n \"There are no commercial lanes out here.

Melkonis stops again, studies the direction finder.',\n \"It's close, real close.\",\n 'How far?',\n \"We should be almost on top of it. I just can't quite... Suddenly, Broussard grabs Standard's arm and points. The others stare in the direction he is pointing.\",\n 'Through the dense clouds of swirling dust we can just barely make out some kind of HUGE SHAPE. As we watch, the dust clears slightly, REVEALING A GROTESQUE SHIP RISING FROM THE SHIP LIKE SOME GIGANTIC TOADSTOOL. It is clearly of non-human manufacture.',\n 'They are struck dumb by the sight of the craft. Finally, Standard finds his voice.',\n \"Martin, uh, we've found it.\",\n '(sharply -- over, filtered) Found what?',\n \"It appears to be some sort of spacecraft. We're going to approach it. They start toward the alien ship. INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY\",\n '(over, filtered) There are no signs of life. No lights... no movement... Roby and Hunter are listening with hypnotic concentration.',\n \"(over, filtered) We're, uh, approaching the base.

I\\'m going to hold the conversation to a minimum from here on. INTERIOR - ALIEN SHIP - DAY The doorway is a glowing geometric blur of light against blackness, spewing dust. In the darkness of the chamber are huge, formless shapes. Standard, Broussard and Melkonis appear silhouetted against the doorway. They switch on flashlight-like devices called \"DATASTICKS\", and step in. Carefully, peering around, they pick their way past the indistinct machinery.',\n 'Air lock?',\n 'Who knows?',\n \"Let's try and find the control room. As they move their lights around, they can see that the walls, ceiling, and machinery are FULL OF HUGE, IRREGULAR HOLES.\",\n 'Look at these holes. This place looks like Swiss cheese. Broussard shines his light up into a huge hole in the ceiling.',\n 'This hole goes up several decks -- looks like somebody was firing a military disintegrator in here. They all peer up the hole into darkness.',\n 'Climbing gear. Standard draws out a stubby spear gun with a graplon attached to it. He aims it up into the hole and fires. The graplon is launched up into darkness, trailing a thin wire. There is a dull CLUNK, and the wire dangles.',\n \"I'll go first.\",\n 'No, you\\'ll follow me. Standard attaches the wire to a powered gear box on his chest, and presses a button. With a mechanical whine, he is pulled up into the hole, using his feet for leverage where he can. Broussard attaches the wire to his own chest unit. INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM OF ALIEN SHIP This chamber is totally dark as Broussard arrives at the top of the hole. Standard stands with his flashlight/camera (\"datastick\") tracing a beam through the hanging dust. Broussard unclips himself from the climbing wire, then raises his own light. At that moment, Melkonis arrives at the top of the hole. THEIR LIGHTS SCAN THE ROOM. The beams are clearly visible as columns of light in the floating dust. They reveal heavy, odd shapes. Broussard stumbles over something. He shines his light down on it. It is a large, glossy urn, brown in color, with peculiar markings. Broussard stands it upright. It has a round opening in the top, and is empty. Suddenly, Melkonis lets out a grunt of shock. Their lights have illuminated something unspeakably grotesque: A HUGE ALIEN SKELETON,',\n 'They approach the skeleton, their lights trained on it. IT IS A',\n 'Holy Christ... Standard shines his light on the console at which the hideous skeleton is seated. He moves his light closer and peers at the panel.',\n 'Look at this... They approach.',\n 'Something has been scratched here... into the veneer. See? Traced raggedly onto the surface of the panel, as by the point of a sharp instrument, is a small triangle: Hearing something, Broussard flashes his light across the room. As the beam scans the walls, it briefly touches on SOMETHING THAT MOVES. Melkonis convulsively yanks out his pistol.',\n 'LOOK OUT, IT MOVED! Standard knocks his hand down.',\n 'Keep away from that gun! Standard shoulders himself in front of the others. Then, slowly, he begins to move toward the far side of the room. They approach a console on the wall, training their lights on it. There is a machine. On the machine, a small bar moves steadily back and forth, sliding noiselessly in its grooves.',\n 'Just machinery.',\n 'But functioning. Melkonis looks down at his direction finder.',\n \"That's where the transmission is coming from. He throws a switch on the direction finder -- with a crackle and a hum, the UNEARTHLY VOICE fills their earphones.\",\n 'A recording. A damned automatic recording. EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - SUNSET SINISTER ANGLE ON THE SNARK. As we watch, the sunlight turns the color of blood, and then the sun is down, leaving murky blackness in its wake. The ring of floodlights on the ship flares into life, feebly combatting the darkness and the storm.

These are photos taken by their \"datasticks\" (flashlight/cameras). Standard is commenting on the changing slides.',\n '... This is the control room... Two or three pictures click onto the screen in succession, showing the suited men standing against banks of machinery.',\n '... Some details of the control room... The SKELETON appears on the screen. The men react with mutters.',\n \"... This is the skeleton... another view of the skeleton... the transmitting device... The triangle that was cut into the alien's console appears.\",\n '...

This is the single most important discovery in history.',\n 'But?',\n 'What killed it?',\n \"Hell, that thing's been dead for years. Maybe hundreds of years. The whole planet's dead.\",\n \"The way I figure it, they landed here for repairs or something, then they couldn't take off again. Maybe the dust ruined their engines. They set up an S.O.S. beacon, but nobody came. So they died.\",\n 'He died.',\n 'What?',\n \"Not they... he... They all turn to look in the direction of Roby's nod. CAMERA MOVES\",\n '... There was only one skeleton. There is a moment of silence.',\n \"Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?\",\n \"Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...\",\n 'And when will you be ready to do that?',\n \"Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.\",\n 'Then why the hell are you sitting around here?',\n 'Right. The men rise and begin to disperse, but Roby remains seated, deep in thought, staring at the skull.

Broussard enlarges the image. The screen now shows a TAPERING STONE PYRAMID on the horizon. They all stare at the image for a long moment.

The beam penetrates only thirty feet or so, then is lost in darkness.',\n \"It's noticeably warmer in here. Warm air rising from below. He starts down, paying out the line and moving down in short hops, pushing off each time with his feet. He stops to catch his breath. His breathing rasps loudly in his helmet.

Standard's voice comes over his earphones.\",\n '(over, filtered) Are you okay in there?',\n \"(gasping for breath) Yeah, I'm okay. Haven't hit bottom yet.

Now he is dangling free in darkness, spinning slowly on the wire as the chest unit unwinds. Finally, his feet hit bottom. He grunts in surprise and almost loses his balance. INTERIOR - TOMB - DAY Broussard is standing on a dusty stone floor, with a feeble column of sunlight shining down around him from the tunnel above. Around is solid darkness. He flashes his datastick around. The beam reveals that he is in a stone room. STRANGE HEIROGLYPHICS are carved into the walls. They have a primitive, religious appearance. Row after row of pictograms stretch from floor to ceiling, some epic history in an unknown language. Huge religious symbols dominate one wall. Spaced at intervals are stylized stone statues, depicting grotesque monsters, half anthropoid, half octopus.\",\n \"It's unbelievable! It's like some kind of tomb... some primitive religion!

For a long moment, the two men regard each other, then STANDARD STEPS FORWARD AND SLAPS ROBY ACROSS THE',\n 'The others are shocked.',\n 'Hey now, what is this?',\n 'Ask him.',\n '(slowly puts his hand to his cheek) I understand why you did that.',\n 'Good.',\n \"He wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there.\",\n 'Yeah... well, maybe he should have.

Faust exits.\",\n \"I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting.\",\n \"(to Standard) I guess I had it coming. Let's call it settled. After a hard stare at Roby, Standard gives him a curt nod and turns his attention to the machinery.\",\n '(slowly) Would somebody fill me in?',\n \"He went into the pyramid alone. We lost radio contact with him. When we pulled him out, it was on his face. It won't come off, not without injuring him.\",\n 'Where did it come from?',\n \"He's the only one that knows that.\",\n 'How does he breathe? They study the monitors.',\n \"Blood's thoroughly oxygenated.\",\n 'Yeah, but how? His nose and mouth are blocked.',\n \"Let's look inside his head. Standard punches some buttons, and on the monitors, a kind of X-ray image in vivid colors appears, depicting Broussard's HEAD AND UPPER\",\n \"The parasite is clearly visible on Broussard's face. In X-ray, the creature is a maze of complicated biology. But the shocking thing is that, in X-ray, we can see that Broussard's jaws are forced wide open, and THE PARASITE HAS EXTRUDED SOME KIND OF LONG TUBE, WHICH IS STUFFED INTO HIS MOUTH AND DOWN HIS THROAT, ending near his stomach.\",\n 'Look at that.',\n \"What is it -- I can't tell anything --\",\n \"It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.\",\n '(turning sick) Oh... God... Hunter bends over and RETCHES.',\n \"I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.\",\n \"It doesn't make any sense. It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.\",\n \"We can't expect to understand a life form like this. We're out of our back yard. Things are different here.\",\n \"Well, can't we kill it? I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.\",\n \"We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it. At least right now it's keeping him alive.\",\n \"How about cutting it off? We can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face.\",\n \"You're right... we can't stand here and do nothing. Standard picks up his dusty breathing mask and pulls it over his head. Then he pulls back on his bulky gloves. Finally, he presses a switch and Broussard slides back out of the booth.\",\n \"(muffled in his mask) Somebody give me a scalpel. Melkonis takes a glittering surgical blade from a slot in the wall, and carefully passes it to Standard. Clumsily because of the gloves, Standard manipulates the knife in his hand till he has a decent grip on it. Then he flicks a little button with his thumb. The scalpel begins to hum. Standard advances on the parasite. The others draw back nervously. Roby reaches over and draws yet a longer blade from the rack, and holds it inconspicuously at his side. Standard bends over the parasite. Carefully, he touches the scalpel to the extreme end of one of the tentacles, where it curves toward the back of Broussard's head. Effortlessly, the electronic blade slides through the alien tissue. Immediately, a urine-like fluid begins to flow from the wound.\",\n \"(muffled) I've made an incision... it's not reacting... but some kind of yellowish fluid is leaking out of the wound... The noxious-looking liquid drips down onto the bedding next to Broussard's head. Instantly, it starts to hiss, and a thin stream of smoke curls up from the stain.\",\n \"(muffled) Hold it, this stuff's smoking! The others REACT nervously. By now, the yellow fluid has eaten a hole through the bunk bed and has dripped down onto the floor below. The metal floor begins to bubble and sizzle, and more smoke rises. The men start to COUGH.\",\n \"God, that smoke's poisonous!\",\n \"(pointing) It's eating a hole in the floor! Abruptly, the men jostle their way out of the room and huddle in the corridor outside, coughing their lungs out. Standard, who is masked, remains. Frantically, he attempts to put a bandage on the wound, but the fluid instantly melts the bandage, and in the process, some of the stuff gets on Standard's gloves. They begin to smoke. Frantically Standard leaps back, pulling off the smouldering gloves. Then he runs out into the corridor and yanks off his mask. INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARY\",\n \"That stuff's eating right through the metal! It's going to eat through the decks and right out through the hull! By this time Standard has started to run for the stairs. INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP Followed by the others, Standard frantically clangs down the stairs to the level below.\",\n 'There! Look! A droplet of the fluid is sizzling on the ceiling. It oozes down and drips to the floor. It bubbles on the floor.',\n 'Jesus, what can we put under it? Standard and Hunter charge down the stairs to the level below. INTERIOR - LEVEL BELOW Standard and Hunter move cautiously down the corridor, looking up at the ceiling.',\n '(pointing) There. Should be coming through about there.',\n \"Careful, don't get under it! INTERIOR - LEVEL ABOVE Roby and Melkonis crouch by the spot on the floor where the acid sizzles.\",\n 'Christ, that stinks. Roby fishes a pen out of his pocket and probes into the hole in the floor.',\n 'Seems to have stopped penetrating. Hunter comes charging up the steps.',\n \"What's happening up here?\",\n \"I think it's fizzled out. Hunter approaches and looks. Roby straightens up, starts to put the pen back in his pocket, then changes his mind and stands holding it by the end.\",\n 'I never saw anything like that in my life... except molecular acid.',\n 'But this thing uses it for blood.',\n \"Hell of a defense mechanism. You don't dare kill it. Standard comes up the stairs.\",\n \"It's stopped?\",\n 'Yes, thank heaven.',\n \"We're just plain lucky. That could have gone right through the hull -- taken weeks to patch it.\",\n 'Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans.',\n 'My God, what about Broussard? They turn and run up the stairs. INTERIOR - INFIRMARY They all come into the room (Roby carrying the partially melted pen). Broussard is still motionless on the bunk, with the thing on his face.',\n \"Did it get on him? Standard approaches and peers at Broussard's head.\",\n 'No, thank God... just missed him.',\n 'Is it still dripping?',\n '(examining it) It appears to have healed itself.',\n 'It makes me sick to see him like that.',\n \"Isn't there some way we can get it off him?\",\n \"I don't see how. But let's do what we can for him. Standard presses a button, and Broussard slides back into the diagnostic coffin. He presses more buttons, and the displays light up again, showing different parts of Broussard's body.\",\n \"I think we'd better get some intravenous feeding started. God knows what that thing is leaching out of him. Standard operates some controls, and the machine begins to invade Broussard's body, sliding needles into him.\",\n \"(studying the screens) Look there, what's that stain on his lungs? The X-ray reveals a spreading dark blot in the vicinity of Broussard's chest. In the center, the stain is completely opaque.\",\n 'It appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort... it blocks the X-rays...',\n 'That tube must be depositing it in him.',\n 'Could be some kind of venom, or poison...',\n 'This is horrible.',\n 'Hey! what about the film?',\n 'What film?',\n 'Broussard had film in his datastick, didn\\'t he? We can see what happened to him. INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM Again we are watching slides in the darkened room. This time Standard, Roby, Melkonis, and Hunter are watching the sequence of photographs taken automatically by Broussard\\'s datastick as he probed the tomb. The camera reveals the \"urns.\" The climax of the sequence of stills comes when THE CREATURE LEAPS OUT OF THE \"URN\" TOWARD THE CAMERA -- and after that the camera drops to a useless angle and proceeds to show a series of meaningless blurs. Then the reel ends.',\n 'That must have been when he got it.',\n \"The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.\",\n '(clicks back through the slides to a picture of one of the \"urns\") At first I thought they were jars too, or artifacts anyway. But they\\'re not. They\\'re eggs, or spore casings. Let\\'s go back to the heiroglyphics.

CLICK. CLICK. Melkonis is changing the slides as they talk, showing different angles on the glyphs.\",\n \"It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.\",\n \"You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits...\",\n 'That sounds a little fanciful...',\n 'Primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment, and this can be used as a starting point for translation...',\n 'What common objects?',\n \"Listen, hadn't somebody better check on Broussard?\",\n \"(rising) I'll do it. The rest of you continue.\",\n \"(rising) I'll come with you.

Standard picks up a stainless steel tray with a lid.',\n \"As long as we're careful not to damage it... Tray in one hand, lid in the other, Standard begins moving slowly around the room.

THE PARASITE DROPS TO',\n '(leaping back) Shit! But the thing is not moving. It lies motionless on the floor, its tentacles curled up. Its color has faded to a dead-looking grey. Without taking his eyes off the thing, Standard reaches behind him and takes a long probe from the wall. He prods the thing; it does not respond.',\n \"I think it's dead. With great care, he uses the probe to fish the motionless parasite into the tray. Then he quickly closes the lid. INTERIOR - LABORATORY Standard, Roby, and Melkonis have the parasite spread-eagled on a stainless steel table, with a bright light on it. It is belly-side up. Wearing gloves, Standard probes at the thing with an instrument.\",\n \"Look at these suckers -- no wonder we couldn't get it off him.\",\n 'Is that its mouth?',\n 'More likely that organ -- the tube- like thing -- fits up in there. With a pair of needle-nosed pliers, Standard fishes in the fleshy aperture. Carefully, he extracts the end of the tube-organ.',\n 'Ugh. Suddenly, it starts to FALL APART IN THE PLIERS.',\n \"Quick -- it's decomposing -- gimme something to grab it with! It begins to SMOKE AND BUBBLE. Roby grabs a long pair of tongs from the wall and thrusts them at Standard -- who throws down the pliers, snatches the tongs and seizes the thing in the tongs. It is smouldering and dripping acid on the floor.\",\n \"Christ! Let's get it out of here! Carrying the thing, he heads for the door. INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP The men run down the passageways, Standard carrying the dripping thing in the tongs. It leaves little smoking droplets on the floor.

By the time Standard is in the lock, Roby is already on the intercom:\",\n '(shouts into intercom) For Chrissake, open the main lock! INTERIOR - AIR LOCK - DAY Roby stumbles in as the inner door closes; and with a heavy whine, the thick surface door rumbles open. Orange sunlight billows in, followed by the inevitable dust. Standard HURLS THE CARCASS OUT, tongs and all. EXTERIOR - BASE OF SHIP - DAY The parasite hits the ground and begins to sink into the dust, smouldering and fuming. INTERIOR - AIR LOCK - DAY The outer door rolls shut.',\n \"(slumping against the wall) My God, it's lethal even when it's dead! Melkonis gets down on his knees and studies the small burn-holes in the floor. Standard opens the inner door and steps out into the corridor. There, he activates the wall intercom and punches out a combination.

His vital functions are strong.',\n 'Good. He switches off the intercom.',\n '(suddenly exhausted) I need some coffee. He turns and walks away.

I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?\",\n '(stroking the cat) About four hours.',\n \"(staring into his coffee cup) I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin. We never should have landed here.\",\n \"Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.

The parasites won. This brings a CHILLY SILENCE.',\n 'Where did the parasites come from?',\n \"They seem native to the planet. It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity. It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.\",\n \"No. It's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites. If there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic.\",\n \"Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?\",\n \"Too primitive. It's a pre- technological construction.

He is garmented in an unusual outfit which makes him look like a riot policeman, including clear plastic helmet. He reaches a corner and turns. But this new passageway has a different gravity orientation -- Standard seems to be walking down a vertical wall. He makes yet another disorienting turn, and now he is walking upside- down.

The corridors in this level are lit by rows of bare bulbs in the ceiling. The effect is ugly and confining. They stop at the foot of the stairs and move into position, spreading the net across the corridor.\",\n 'Okay.',\n '(looking at tracker and nodding down the passageway) That way. They begin to walk down the passageway, footsteps clanging on the raw metal flooring. It is extremely dark.',\n 'What happened to the lights?',\n \"Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em. They switch on the helmet lights.\",\n 'Hold it. They all stop quickly, almost stumbling.',\n \"(whispering) It's within 4 meters. Roby and Melkonis heft the net, each keeping his prod in hand. Faust, prod in one hand and tracker in the other, has the unpleasant job of approaching the source of the signal. He moves with great care, in a half crouch, ready to leap back at any second, prod extended, constantly glancing at the tracker. The tracking device leads him right up to a small hatch or door in one wall. Behind his plastic mask, sweat is pouring down Faust's face as he sets down the tracker and reaches for the little door. He raises the prod, grasps the door handle, yanks it open, and jams the electric prod inside.\",\n 'Instinctively, they throw the net over it, but:',\n '(very annoyed) Oh, hold it!

It's in there now! On the other side of the door, CRASHING AND BANGING can be heard.\",\n \"What's it doing, having a seizure?\",\n 'It started crashing around right after we locked it in.',\n 'Now what?',\n 'I guess we open the door and net it.',\n 'I hate to open that door. Again the thing can be heard CRASHING AROUND INSIDE.',\n \"It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles.\",\n 'Well we better do something.',\n \"Maybe we don't have to. It's trapped in there. We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth.\",\n \"(snaps) Don't be an idiot.\",\n 'I know what we can do. We can pump poison gas into the room and kill it.

Now we go in. Standard steps to the door and opens it. A thick cloud of gas billows out. INTERIOR - FOOD STORAGE ROOM The room is thick with the poison gas. The men look like insects in their gasmasks. The food packages are ripped to shreds, and foodstuffs are scattered all over the floor.',\n 'Looks like he helped himself. Carefully, the men poke through the garbage, net and prods raised. Then Hunter points.',\n 'God damn it. They all look where he is pointing. In the wall, A VENTILATOR GRILL',\n 'It escaped.

That wouldn't poison the air.\",\n 'So one of us goes into the airshaft and drives the thing along --',\n 'While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net.',\n 'Sounds like a rough one.',\n 'Got a better idea? Hunter shrugs.',\n 'So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?',\n \"Let's be democratic. He tears five small sheets of paper from a pad on his console. On one of them, he draws a large X. Then he wads each piece of paper into a tiny little ball. He rolls the paperballs between his hands and tosses them on the table like dice.\",\n 'Martin, take one.

Finally, Faust hands him a tracking device.',\n \"Well, uh... good luck. I hope you won't need me, but if you do, I'm here.\",\n '(grimly) Right. Hunter turns and climbs into the ventilator opening, which is just large enough to crawl through. INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT It is completely dark in the shaft. Hunter reaches up and turns on his helmet light. Then he switches on his radio.',\n 'Hey, do you guys read me down there? INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM Standard, Melkonis and Roby are spreading out the net. We hear the hum of huge cooling plants, and their hair ruffles. Large airshafts run off in different directions.',\n \"Yeah, we're getting into position. INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT\",\n \"Okay, I'm starting now. He begins to crawl forward into the narrow metal tunnel. He turns a corner. After a couple more tight turns, THE TRACKER SUDDENLY BEEPS. Hunter twitches. He raises his flamethrower and FIRES A BLAST INTO THE DARKNESS. It roars loudly in the confined tube, and the air instantly heats up. Smoke drifts back into his face. He begins to sweat. INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM Roby points to a large rectangular opening in one wall.\",\n \"(pointing) There. That's where it's got to come out. He throws a switch, and a large metal panel rises and seals off the opening.\",\n \"That's a flip-flop gate to channel the air, but we can use it to trap the thing.\",\n \"Right now let's keep it closed. Melkonis is setting up a little portable unit with a screen on it. The screen shows a section of the ship's schematic.\",\n \"I've got Hunter... and something else as well, in front of him.\",\n 'Are they close?',\n \"They're on the next level up.\",\n \"Let's get moving with this net. They lift the net up, holding it in front of the opening. INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT Hunter is still crawling on hands and knees. Up ahead, he can see that the shaft takes an abrupt downward turn. He crawls toward the down angle, then fires another blast from his flamethrower. Then he starts crawling down, head first. When he is nearly upside-down, the shaft takes yet another turning which puts him into a nearly impossible position, almost immobilized. Then the tracker starts BEEPING LIKE CRAZY. Frantically, he fumbles the flamethrower around, but the space is narrow -- it is difficult maneuvering. He hears a HISSING CRY up ahead, and claws scrambling on metal. Then he has the weapon into position, and sprays another lethal flaming burst toward the sound.

Okay?',\n 'Okay.',\n \"(to Roby) And you and I will bag it, and then we'll take it to the ventral air lock, got it?\",\n '(tensely) Uh-huh.

He and Roby heft their respective ends of the net, crouched to catch the small creature when it darts out. Melkonis picks up his electric prod.',\n 'Open the vent, Sandy. Melkonis reaches over and throws the switch. The metal gate drops down, opening up the shaft.',\n 'Melkonis lets out a horrible shriek, and the thing grabs his head in one claw and TWISTS IT OFF LIKE A MAN PULLING THE HEAD OFF A CHICKEN, THEN THROWS IT TO THE FLOOR WITH AN AUDIBLE CLUNK.',\n 'Standard and Roby are left standing in shock. After a moment, Hunter climbs out of the shaft.',\n 'What happened? Where is it? They break from their paralysis, and run toward the opening the creature just leaped into. It is another shaft, going down into darkness.',\n '(awed) How did it get so big?',\n 'By eating our food supplies.',\n \"Where's Melkonis?

(rises) I'll go get it.\",\n \"No, I don't want us separated.\",\n \"You just sealed it off; it can't get to that section.\",\n \"Don't count on it.\",\n 'We sure need this flamethrower.',\n 'All right... but do not go below decks.',\n 'Right. (heads for the door)',\n 'And be right back. Faust exits.',\n \"I think it's time we took a hard look at those heiroglyphs. Roby begins to punch buttons; the photographs of the heiroglyphics appear on some of the screens.\",\n 'Can you make out any pattern in all that?',\n \"(baffled) Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.\",\n 'I know it looks like a senseless jumble, but if you look closely, there are recognizable forms.',\n 'Recognizable! In that?',\n \"In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.\",\n 'Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard.

And there it is. Out of meaningless geometric symbols on a wall, it has become possible to recognize each stage in the alien's life cycle.\",\n \"This is all the same creature. We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle.\",\n 'Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals...',\n '... And Broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.',\n 'You will notice, though, that there are no more phases. Only four forms are shown. After that the pattern repeats.',\n 'Which presumably means...',\n '... More spores coming.

INTERIOR - CORRIDORS Loose papers and articles of furniture hurtle through the passageways, as Roby hurries toward the rock, partly running, partly sucked along by the air current. EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE A huge plume of steam grows from the side of the ship, with all kinds of tiny loose particles tumbling out in it. INTERIOR - CORRIDORS Whipped by the hurricane wind, Roby crashes to a momentary halt against a wall. As he hesitates there, trying to regain his balance,',\n 'Ignoring the monster, he pushes off from the wall and starts running again. INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK Roby stops himself by grabbing the edge of a doorway at the end of the hall down from the airlock. Here, the wind is really terrific -- his clothes flap on his body and all kinds of things fly by -- the sound is a DEAFENING WHISTLE. Instantly, Roby starts turning a large wheel, which begins to close a sliding hatch door, closing off the air lock corridor. As the hatch closes, THE CURRENT DECREASES, THEN IS FINALLY CUT OFF AS HE SEALS IT. Done in, he collapses to the floor. Then he clutches his throat and begins to gasp for breath. Because of the thinness of the air, THE SOUND LEVEL IN THE SHIP IS VERY ODD -- THIN, DISTANT, ALMOST INAUDIBLE. Roby is gasping loudly, but we can barely hear him; and his footsteps boom thinly like a man walking underwater. INTERIOR - CORRIDORS Clutching his throat, he comes across the others -- Standard and Hunter -- and they are all choking, clawing at their throats, gasping like fishes out of water. They are sweating heavily and their noses bleed. They try to speak to each other, but the sound is so muffled we can only hear distant croaks. Standard mumbles something and stumbles down the hall. The others follow him. INTERIOR - MAIN AIR TANK ROOM The door bursts open and Standard reels in, his footsteps pinging thinly on the metal flooring. We see several rows of large oxygen tanks, all connected by hoses to a few petcocks. Standard staggers to these and starts twisting the handles, opening them. THERE IS A PIERCING HISS OF ESCAPING AIR, AND THE SOUND LEVEL GRADUALLY RETURNS TO NORMAL as Standard and the others sink to the floor, gasping in the oxygen gratefully. Finally they have recovered enough to be able to sit up.',\n 'How much oxygen did we lose? Standard rises unsteadily and peers at the gauges.',\n \"We've got six hours left.\",\n '(groans) Oh my God.',\n 'Does anybody know what happened?',\n 'I saw it. Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door. His body held it open.',\n 'Can we get to him?',\n \"No, I had to seal off a whole section. We'd lose too much of our remaining air if we opened the connecting door. INTERIOR - AIR LOCK Faust's body, crushed in the inner door, floats weightlessly in the vacuum. His nose and mouth are crusted with huge gobs of dried blood. INTERIOR - BRIDGE The three survivors -- Standard, Roby and Hunter -- slump into chairs. The cat emerges from a hiding place, yowling with fear.\",\n '(picking up the cat) Poor kitty; puss puss puss.',\n \"At least we're rid of the damn monster.

Now come on -- I want to hear every suggestion you can come up with, no matter how wild.',\n \"We can't kill it on board. It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.\",\n \"I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.\",\n \"Let's hear it.\",\n 'Okay. First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.',\n \"That'll blow the ship up.\",\n \"Right... but it'll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core. In the meantime, we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship.\",\n 'Blow the ship up?',\n 'And the creature with it. We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat.',\n \"But the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed.\",\n \"Doesn't matter -- we're already at light speed. And when we get back to the Colonies, they'll pick us up in the network.\",\n \"What about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold? That's the only reason we came out here. We'd have to abandon them all. We'd be broke.\",\n 'Our lives are more important. Anyway, we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat.',\n \"No, it won't work and I just realized why. There's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. Only one of us could survive.\",\n 'Yeah... I forgot.',\n \"But the idea's good, if we could just turn it around somehow. They think.\",\n 'If we could just get the creature into the lifeboat, we could launch it into space and blow it up.',\n \"Good! That's good!\",\n 'We can load the lifeboat up with explosives and trigger them remotely, once the lifeboat is in space.',\n \"I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.\",\n 'We can use the flamethrower.',\n \"It's not going to work.\",\n \"You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.\",\n 'The flamethrower needs more fuel.',\n \"Right. We've got a lot to accomplish. Let's get moving. INTERIOR - MINING & CARGO BAY The three men come down steps into this rather dirty area of the ship. A lot of tools and large items of machinery are stored around.\",\n 'SHAPES. Each container is well packed and labelled.',\n 'Which explosive should we use?',\n \"I'd suggest the N-13 sticks. They're portable, and they can be radio detonated. Hunter begins to unlock a locker and draw out long, red sticks like broomhandles, with tiny printing on them. Meanwhile, ROBY IS STARING AT THE ROWS OF METAL CANNISTERS. He touches one of them.\",\n \"You know, it's funny -- this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up -- this treasure, the paydirt -- it'll make it back to Irth just fine -- even if we're not with it.\",\n 'Here, carry these.

They begin to carry the explosives up the steps. INTERIOR - CORRIDOR The three men are carrying their equipment along the hallway, when Hunter's tracker suddenly BEEPS.\",\n 'Hold it! They all stop. The tracker BEEPS AGAIN. Hunter puts down his stuff and points the tracker around.',\n '(nodding up some steps) Up there. They all look at each other. Standard puts down his bundle and picks up the flamethrower.',\n 'So what do we do? Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?',\n \"Now. If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space. Standard hefts the flamethrower and starts up the steps. INTERIOR - DIM STAIRWELL Standard's face is tense as he advances up the circular steps. Suddenly, a METALLIC TAPPING SOUND is heard. He freezes. Then he continues up. EXTERIOR - DORSAL OBSERVATION DOME - VIEW OF OUTER SPACE The view of interstellar space is spectacular. As Standard comes up the steps, the METALLIC TAPPING is heard again. Standard looks around. Then he sees it -- BROUSSARD'S CORPSE FLOATS OUTSIDE THE GLASS OF THE DOME. It is tangled in some rigging, and the movement of the machinery causes the cadaver to tap on the glass periodically.\",\n \"(shouts) You can come up! It's safe! The others come up the steps.\",\n \"(spying the corpse) Oh -- Jesus -- Broussard's corpse is blue and bloated where the wrappings have torn loose. Bumping against the glass, he looks like he wants to come in.\",\n \"The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.\",\n '(horrified) Should we go outside and bring him in?',\n \"No... the risk is too great. Perhaps after we've destroyed the thing. Glancing back, the men retreat from the observation dome. Broussard remains against the glass, peering in with dead eyes. INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP The floor slopes upward slightly here as the corridor funnels in and ends in the entrance to a narrow passageway or crawl-way. This passageway connects the nose of the ship with the lifeboat. The three men come up to the entrance to the passageway, carrying the equipment. They duck in and walk the short distance to the lifeboat. INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT The passageway connects into the rear of the lifeboat. It is an extremely simple, stripped-down vehicle; even the metal struts and beams-are exposed. A single hypersleep freezer takes up a fair amount of floor space. It is an escape-craft, nothing more.\",\n '(pointing) Along the base of the walls there. They begin to stack the red broomsticks against the base of the walls on both sides of the lifeboat, and to wire them into position tightly.',\n 'This should do it.',\n \"I should hope so! And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.\",\n 'It will be.',\n '(surveys the craft uneasily) What we really need is some red meat in here for bait.',\n \"Well, if we had some, I'd eat it. I'm starting to get hungry. By this time, they are exiting.

INSERT: THREE CRUMPLED PIECES OF PAPER. Three hands pick them up. ANGLE ON ROBY. He unfolds his paper, turns it so the others can see it. It has a big X on it. ANOTHER ANGLE - SHORTLY LATER.

Roby settles himself at the controls, runs through them briefly to familiarize himself. Using a switch, he opens and closes the lifeboat door a couple of times. It slams open and shut quite rapidly. He presses a few buttons and sets the launch button to \"READY.\" Then STANDARD\\'S VOICE comes from the communicator:',\n \"(over, filtered) We've got something on the tracker... got to be it, it's too big for the cat.

I'm not getting anything.\",\n 'Let me go first; you stay behind me. Carefully, Standard advances down the corridor. Then THE CREATURE POPS OUT OF HIDING BEHIND HUNTER, AND PICKS HIM UP.',\n \"Standard whirls around, sees the thing clutching Hunter. It holds him off to one side, as though to keep Standard from getting at him. Standard doesn't know what to do.\",\n 'The flamethrower!',\n \"I can't, the acid will pour out! At that moment the creature TAKES A BITE OUT OF HUNTER, WHO SCREAMS IN\",\n 'Standard can take it no longer; he raises the flamethrower and fires',\n \"Standard instantly stops firing, but now Hunter is a kicking ball of flame, held out at arm's length by the monster.

Then the communicator goes dead, and all he hears is a rush of static.\",\n \"Hello? Standard? Hunter? He waits quite a while for a response, but we can see from his expression that he expects none. He drops his face into his hands. When he lifts his head again, he has managed to summon a certain amount of resolve. INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP Roby walks along watching the tracker, carrying a pistol in the other hand. He comes across Standard's flamethrower, lying on the floor. He picks it up, substituting it for the pistol. Then he continues to follow the tracker; it takes him down the steps into the maintenance level. INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL Roby follows the device for a short distance until it indicates that the source of the signal is directly under his feet. Looking down, he sees that he is standing on a square metal plate. Getting down on his hands and knees, he removes the heavy plate, revealing a black opening with a ladder going down. Substituting the tracker for a flashlight, but still carrying the flamethrower, Roby starts down the ladder.

    "VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) is a lexical-based model used for text sentiment analysis. It is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. VADER is plug and play: it can be applied directly to unlabeled text data without tokenization. VADER is also sensitive to negation, capitalization and punctuation. Given a sentence, VADER returns a dictionary of scores in each of four categories: negative, neutral, positive and compound (normalized score for the three before). We can use the compound score to map sentiment in a uni-variate time series."

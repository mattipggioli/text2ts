Fear grips his face as he looks over at the Man, who is now upright and awake. They hold their breath, listening over the DRUMMING CHORUS.\",\n \"It's louder this time. Unmistakable. The Teen watches as the Man pulls a crystal-handled dagger from under his pillow and stealthily creeps to the door. The Man cautiously leans in and peers through the bamboo slats.

He is immediately on his feet, he kneels at Daniel's side and studies the symbol on the teen's ankle. It has stopped glowing but is painfully raw. Directly below this fresh wound are\",\n \"They are the same size, but each symbol is subtly different. Time has transformed them into raised, snake-smooth scars.

The dying sun tints the clouds and the sky in violent apocalyptic hues.',\n \"This is the part I hate the most. The running. But it's the only thing in my life that's real. The rest is a lie.

Daniel has his head against the window, brooding, listening to an iPod.\",\n 'We are hiding from the Mogadorians. A brutal race that wiped out our entire planet, Lorien.',\n 'Plastic flags whip overhead. Daniel leans against a silver SUV and watches Henri negotiate with the DEALER.',\n \"Only nine children escaped the genocide. We were each given a number and sent here to hide. I don't know where the others are. I only know when one of them is murdered.\",\n 'Daniel sits on the edge of a bathtub. He gently unwraps the bandage that covers his ankle and fearfully inspects the neat scab that has formed over the wound.',\n 'I got the first scar when I was eight. I woke up screaming. We lived in Vermont. The second was on a Tilt-a-Whirl at a fair in Michigan. I was 12. Yesterday was the third. His finger traces the lines of the other two scars.',\n 'The lush tropical landscape has browned into flat, dormant farmland. The silver SUV charges through the bleak monotony.',\n \"Because of the spell our Elders cast, the Mogs can only kill us in order. That's the reason I've survived this long. But our enemy is relentless.\",\n 'Daniel is asleep with his earphones on. Henri glances over, his mask of certainty momentarily slips. He looks like a soldier heading into a battle he knows cannot be won.',\n 'Now their hunt has turned to me. I am number 4.',\n 'A tired neon sign illuminates the big rigs that RUMBLE past, headed to destinations unknown.',\n 'Daniel sullenly stares at a stack of untouched pancakes. Henri slides into the booth, all business.',\n \"Florida's clear. I sent a letter to the school and there's nothing in the papers.\",\n \"I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye. Henri keeps going, passes an envelope across the table.\",\n 'New IDs. Daniel pulls out his birth certificate, reads the name.',\n \"Just when I think you can't get any less original, you lower the bar.\",\n \"I'm not interested in originality. I'm interested in untraceable. There are 335,321 John Smiths in the United States. (Note: from this point on, Daniel will be called John.) John looks at him, then abruptly gets up and storms away. Henri drops $20 on the table and calmly heads after him.\",\n \"A row of ancient arcade games blinks. John angrily stabs the buttons of a Space Invaders machine as Henri approaches. They are alone. John's eyes never leave the video screen.\",\n \"It's been so long since the last scar.\",\n \"You got lulled into a false sense of security. That's my fault. John struggles to keep his temper in check.\",\n \"I liked Florida. I liked having friends. I liked feeling normal. Henri's face softens with paternal compassion.\",\n \"I wish that you could have a normal life -- but you can't. Only now does John turn and face him. His eyes blaze with frustration.\",\n 'Then why fake it? Why not just go hole up in the wilderness.',\n \"That's exactly what Number 3 did.\",\n 'John looks at him, confused. Henri pulls up an article on his iPhone and hands it to John.',\n \"It's from an African news site. A man and his son went missing two nights ago. The locals think they were taken by strange beasts. John understands the implication.\",\n 'Piken.',\n 'The Mogadorians are natural-born hunters. Blending in is our best protection.',\n 'So we just keep moving from town to town?',\n 'Until I say otherwise -- yes. John waits as a TRUCKER passes through the room. His voice softens but never loses its intensity.',\n 'I want to be from someplace, Henri.',\n 'You are.',\n \"Lorien's your home, I don't even remember it. John's tone rubs Henri the wrong way.\",\n \"Like it or not, it's your home too. You have a responsibility to those who died.\",\n 'Henri and John climb in.',\n \"I want a say in where we live. (off Henri's face) You already picked it, didn't you?\",\n 'Henri REVS the ENGINE to life.',\n \"Cheer up, you're going to be living in Paradise.\",\n \"A frigid sheet of RAIN POUNDS the sign that's planted on the side of this narrow stretch of rural blacktop:\",\n 'The silver SUV streaks past, its wipers working overtime. It kicks up a spray as it speeds down Main Street. The dinky storefronts are garishly decorated for Halloween.',\n 'The leaves are washed in a thousand shades of gold. The SUV barrels along the drive that twists through the woods.',\n 'Henri pulls up in front of a small house. It sits by itself, surrounded by trees. Water sluices off the weather-worn garage in the yard behind it. A WOMAN steps out of a minivan to greet them.',\n \"She looks even perkier than the realtor in Florida. A warm smile graces her round face and she's clutching a fruit basket. For the record, she is called ANNIE.\",\n \"What's your name?\",\n 'John Smith.',\n 'Where are you from, John?',\n 'Arizona.',\n 'Why did you move to Paradise?',\n \"Because you're an asshole. John waits for a reaction but doesn't get one...\",\n 'Because my dad needs peace and quiet to research his book. Henri nods and smiles wryly.',\n 'This was a lot easier when you were',\n 'The front door swings open and Annie proudly escorts Henri and John inside.',\n 'Here we are. Home sweet home. They scan the faded interior. The place is in desperate need of a makeover. A grandfather clock pensively TICKS at the end of the hall. Annie remains relentlessly optimistic.',\n 'First impressions?',\n \"It's perfect. Annie places the fruit basket on the dining table and begins turning on the lights.\",\n \"That's one word for it. Stewing, John exits into the hall with his duffel bag. Annie reads the strained dynamic.\",\n 'I feel your pain. I have a daughter his age. Apparently, I ruin her life on a daily basis. John steps back in, holding a sun-faded poster featuring NFL great Bernie Kosar.',\n \"This guy was covering a hole in my wall. Annie's cheeks blush with annoyance.\",\n \"I told the handyman to patch that before you arrived. I'm so sorry.\",\n 'Henri is all charm, gently leads her to the front door.',\n \"Don't you worry about it. She nods, grateful.\",\n \"We'll knock it off the rent. Keep the poster, Bernie Kosar brings good luck here in the Buckeye State.\",\n \"The rain has stopped. The wind RUSTLES the trees. John lifts out the last box. As he closes the trunk, he doesn't notice the hitchhiking gecko hotfoot it out.\",\n 'Henri is busy setting up his computer station. John dumps the box on the floor.',\n \"That's the last of them. I'm hitting the sack.\",\n 'I need a new photo first. John crosses and stands against the wall.',\n 'Say Paradise. John gives him a withering look. Henri flashes off a shot. The camera is cabled to one of the laptops. TIGHT ON LAPTOP: The image of John pixelates onto a digital grid and a face-recognition program begins to map his facial structure. Henri turns to another laptop.',\n \"I've imputed the new search words: Daniel Jones. Big Pine Key. Sunset High School. You think of any others?\",\n 'Yeah, this place sucks.',\n 'Henri swivels to face him.',\n \"If there's a story or picture of you on the internet, this program will find it. Our enemy doesn't know who you are -- I want to keep it that way. John nods, knows he's being a jerk.\",\n \"Sand Dollar Beach, that's where we were jet skiing. Henri types it in when something SCRATCHES at the door. Their heads instantly turn towards the sound. Tense SILENCE. SLOW PUSH IN ON THE DOOR as another SCRATCH echoes. Henri is on his feet. He flicks off the lights and silently signals John to retreat down the hall. With the cool air of an assassin, Henri unzips a duffel bag and pulls out a sleek crystal-handled dagger. As he steps to the door...\",\n '... John crouches in the dark, clutching a baseball bat. Suddenly, the light in the bedroom buzzes back on. He holds his breath as the door swings open. He looks up and is relieved to see Henri.',\n \"I found our intruder -- he's a little small for a Mogadorian. At that moment,\",\n \"slips between Henri's legs. It cocks its head, studies John's face, then pads forward and licks his cheek.\",\n 'The dog greedily laps a bowl of milk.',\n \"He's starving, doesn't have any collar or tags.\",\n 'Must have been dumped.',\n \"You know, another pair of eyes and ears watching the house wouldn't be a bad thing. Henri considers the request, nods. John playfully ruffles the dog's head.\",\n 'What are you going to call him?',\n 'Since I need all the luck I can get -- how about Bernie Kosar?',\n 'John enters, dressed in black, ready for his first day of school. He dumps his backpack on a chair. Henri places a plate with an omelette and perfectly browned hash browns in front of him.',\n \"Wow. You outdid yourself. What's up? Henri lifts a red backpack into view. John stares at it.\",\n 'I already have a backpack.',\n 'This one has five days of rations, spare clothes, cash and a handheld GPS. Keep it with you at all times.',\n 'Henri, come on.',\n \"Game's changed. You're in the crosshairs now. You have to be ready to leave at a moment's notice. With or without me. John stares at the backpack, takes in this new reality. He pushes the plate away, snatches the backpack and heads out the door. Henri stares at the omelette, tastes a pinch of hash browns, then puts the plate on the floor on his way out. It takes Bernie 2.5 seconds to race over and start to eat.\",\n \"Jack-o'-lanterns stare out from the “HALLOWEEN BLOCK PARTY” banner strung across the red brick facade. Henri drives away. John slides the red backpack onto his shoulder when he hears a FAMILIAR BARK. He turns and is surprised to find\",\n 'The little dog is sitting by the flagpole wagging his white- tipped tail. John crosses to him, baffled.',\n 'Bernie, what the hell... were you hiding in the car? He scoops the dog into his arms.',\n 'Hey, I was about to take a picture of the little guy. John turns and finds',\n \"She's his age and is holding an old 35mm Nikon. There is something about her unforced beauty that is instantly enchanting. John shuffles, uncharacteristically nervous.\",\n \"He's not supposed to be here.\",\n 'Go home. Now. Bernie hops out of his arms and obediently runs towards home.',\n \"He's really well-trained. How long have you had him? John turns away.\",\n 'Sorry about your shot.',\n 'No worries. He begins walking towards the entrance.',\n \"You just moved into the house on Old Mill Road. It's John, right?\",\n 'John swings back, concerned.',\n \"Don't worry, I'm not stalking you. My mom said she rented it to a guy with a son my age. Since I know every other face on this quad, that had to be you.\",\n \"I'm Sarah. He nods.\",\n 'Where are you from?',\n 'Someplace warmer.',\n \"I don't think that qualifies as an actual answer.\",\n 'I need to register. She raises her camera to snap a shot of him.',\n 'Whoa. What are you doing?',\n \"Capturing your first day, even though you're technically six weeks late.\",\n \"Please don't point that at me.\",\n \"Afraid the camera's going to steal your soul? She lifts the viewfinder to her eye, adjusts focus. Annoyed, he covers the lens with his hand.\",\n \"What's your problem? I said no.\",\n \"It's only for the yearbook. John regains his composure.\",\n \"I'm not big into having my picture taken. Sorry. As he heads away, Sarah watches, intrigued. CAMERA TRACKS TO REVEAL MARK JAYNE monitoring the encounter. He's the star quarterback and his chiselled jaw tenses with jealousy.\",\n 'Loaded with textbooks, John instinctively bows his head as he passes the black eye of a hall security camera and steps to a locker. He reaches for the combination lock when',\n 'viciously sideswipes him. The textbooks scatter across the checkerboard linoleum. John sees the culprit is Mark Jayne, who offers him a taunting grin. John fights his urge to react and watches as Mark struts over to his POSSE OF JOCKS.',\n \"Welcome to Paradise, irony not included. John looks at the teen standing two lockers down. He's got a battered skateboard tucked into his backpack and wears an Army surplus jacket. This is SAM GOODE -- genius by birth, slacker by choice. He nods after Mark.\",\n \"His name's Mark Jayne. Quarterback, sheriff's son, he's three years into the best four years of his life. John begins retrieving the fallen books. Sam helps.\",\n 'Do yourself a favor -- stay off his radar.',\n \"Didn't know I was on it.\",\n 'You were talking to Sarah Harte.',\n 'She was talking to me.',\n 'Mark and Sarah have been exclusive since Freshmen year.',\n \"John looks down the hall and sees Mark wrap his arm around Sarah's shoulder.\",\n \"If there's another guy in her airspace, he shoots them down. You got a warning shot. John piles the books into his locker.\",\n \"Maybe I'll fire back next time.\",\n \"Look, you're new, so let me tell you how things work in this misnamed backwater. Football players are gods -- the rest of us are mere mortals. If you want to survive, keep your head down and don't make waves.\",\n 'You sound like my dad.',\n 'Obviously a wise man.',\n \"I'm Sam by the way. Sam extends his hand. John doesn't take it.\",\n 'Thanks for the download. As he SLAMS his locker shut...',\n \"It's an impressive structure with wraparound bleachers. The Junior gym class jogs around the track. John hangs in the middle of the pack, with his hoodie up, blending in. They pass the GIRLS who are stretching on the pristine field. Sarah's eyes drift towards John. The COACH blows a whistle.\",\n \"Alright, people. Let's hit the gym. The assembled teens GROAN and fan off towards the mouth of a tunnel that stares out from the base of the bleachers.\",\n 'John emerges from the tunnel via a door by the stage. Some of his classmates are on the court, passing and dribbling.',\n 'Okay, half court, three on three. Girls have this basket, boys have that one.',\n 'Two simultaneous games are in progress. John sits on the sidelines waiting his turn. He avoids eye contact with Sarah who is sitting in the shadow of the basket. However, he does notice Mark Jayne enter and approach her.',\n \"New kid, you're up. Show me what you've got. John steps onto the court and waits for the ball to come his way. He steals a glance and sees Sarah and Mark arguing. A blur of orange. John swings back and catches the ball. Just as he shoots, he's distracted by Sarah's upset voice.\",\n 'goes wild, misses the basket but hits the glass backboard with such force that it',\n \"Mark and Sarah are inadvertently forced to separate as shards rain down. All eyes turn to John, who's annoyed at his momentary lapse. TEENS HOOT. The Coach BLOWS his whistle.\",\n 'Enough! Hit the showers.',\n 'LeBron, grab a broom.

When he turns back, he finds',\n 'The dog is studying him with his head cocked.',\n \"Let's keep this our little secret. OFF Bernie's inquisitive eyes...\",\n 'John joins the line. He sees Sarah sitting by herself, inspecting a photographic contact sheet. His view is blocked by Sam. John rubs his hands which are oddly sweaty.',\n \"First day here and you're already destroying school property. So much for not making waves. John moves past him and grabs a tray. He's flushed and his face is now hot and red.\",\n 'It was an accident.',\n \"I hear the real spectator sport was Mark and Sarah's blowout. John wipes his brow, distracted.\",\n 'Dude, you okay?',\n 'Fine. At that moment, Mark Jayne and his buddy, KEVIN, cut in front of them. Annoyed, John taps Mark on the shoulder.',\n 'You got a problem?',\n 'Line starts back there.',\n 'Football players get priority.',\n \"Where's that posted?\",\n 'Unwritten rule.',\n \"I'm surprised your boyfriend didn't tell you. Sam puts his hands up and backs away. Mark smirks at John.\",\n \"If you don't know your place around here, things can get rough. John holds his ground.\",\n \"In that case, I guess I better ask you where I should sit. I was thinking about grabbing that chair next to your girlfriend. In a flash of anger, Mark whips up his tray, hammers it into John's chest, knocking him to the floor.\",\n \"You want to talk trash? Let's see you back it up. John tries to stand, but is suddenly overcome with a wave of pain. He looks down at his hands and is alarmed to see\",\n 'blooming from his palms!

But as Sam runs off, John heads in the other direction.\",\n \"Henri's SUV roars into view, whipping up a tornado of leaves.\",\n 'Strips of negatives hang on drying lines. John bursts in and SLAMS the door. He slips off his backpack, opens his hands. TIGHT ON HIS EYES -- the brilliant light from his palms shrinks his irises to pinpricks. The luminescence is crisp, mercury-glass bright and grows stronger every second. Suddenly, the door opens. John spins in shock. A figure strides through the blinding glare, gently takes his hands and folds them into fists.',\n 'John looks at him, confusion and fear etched on his face.',\n \"Henri, what's happening to me?\",\n \"Calm down. You're going to be okay. John angrily holds up one of his luminescent hands.\",\n 'On what planet is this okay?',\n 'Yours.',\n 'I need to get you out of here.',\n \"John steps out of the darkroom wearing Henri's heavy coat. His hands are balled and stuffed into the pockets.

What the hell's going on?\",\n 'Your first Legacy is starting to manifest.',\n 'Legacy?',\n 'An extraordinary ability. Yours is called Lumen. They start a lot sooner on Lorien. I was beginning to fear yours would never emerge.',\n \"You knew this was going to happen? Why didn't you say anything?\",\n \"I didn't want to worry you. You were already under enough pressure.\",\n \"I'm sorry. John acknowledges the apology, but looks at him, suspicious.\",\n 'What else have you been hiding from me?',\n 'The curtains are drawn. Bernie Kosar dozes on the couch while John and Henri sit at the table, staring at the Box.',\n \"This couldn't be opened until your first Legacy appeared. Ready? John nods nervously. Henri places the fingertips of his right hand onto five petal-shaped discs inlaid onto the lid. John cautiously follows suit and places his fingers on the “petals” fanned across the opposite side.\",\n 'momentarily glow and a SHARP CLICK echoes from within. John and Henri pull their hands away and watch as the Box miraculously comes to life. Fissures of light sweep across the lines of inlaid stone, dividing the lid into sections that begin to twist and reform like high-tech origami.',\n \"Whoa. PUSH IN ON Bernie as he sits up and watches the Box unfold. Like an intricate jigsaw, the sections finally regroup, creating a new pattern on the lid. It's a familiar geometric symbol. John touches the crystal pendant that hangs from his neck -- the symbols are an exact match.\",\n 'Open it. John nods, cautiously lifts the lid, revealing a neat assortment of velvet pouches and an array of colored rocks. They range in size and color but all share a serene beauty.',\n 'What are they?',\n \"Crystals from Lorien's core. They'll guide us in your training. John tries to reach for one, but Henri slaps his hand away.\",\n 'Place your hand over them. John follows the instruction and is amazed when a walnut- sized crystal floats up from the Box. It slowly begins to spin and project',\n 'Our solar system. Henri points to a planet. Its oceans are dark with pollution and its sprawling continents are barren and treeless.',\n \"That's what Lorien looked like thousands of years ago. We had all the problems that Earth has today. The planet was dying until our people made a collective decision to change and slowly Lorien began to heal itself -- that's when the Legacies started. John watches as the spinning planet transforms before his eyes. Its oceans turn a vibrant chroma-key blue and the land masses become a lush emerald green.\",\n 'Only a select few developed these abilities. They became known as the Garde.',\n \"That's what I am?\",\n 'Like your parents and grandparents. John considers this new information.',\n \"The other children in the ship... Henri finishes John's thought.\",\n \"They're Garde as well. Once you've mastered your Legacies, we'll find them and face the Mogadorians together. John looks at Henri, curious.\",\n 'What Legacy do you have?',\n \"I don't have any and never will. I'm your Cepan -- a teacher.

    "VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) is a lexical-based model used for text sentiment analysis. It is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. VADER is plug and play: it can be applied directly to unlabeled text data without tokenization. VADER is also sensitive to negation, capitalization and punctuation. Given a sentence, VADER returns a dictionary of scores in each of four categories: negative, neutral, positive and compound (normalized score for the three before). We can use the compound score to map sentiment in a uni-variate time series."

Next, he gets a handful of water and splashes it on his face. The water runs down his chin and drips. He breathes heavily, with closed eyes.

Well, maybe you are, Keyes, but let's take a look at this Dietrichson claim, Accident and Double Indemnity. You were pretty good in there for a while, all right. You said it wasn't an accident. Check. You said it wasn't suicide. Check. You said it was murder. Check and double check. You thought you had it cold, all wrapped up in tissue paper, with pink ribbons around it. It was perfect, except that it wasn't, because you made a mistake, just one tiny little mistake. When it came to picking the killer, you picked the wrong guy, if you know what I mean.
